**Project Title:** Rented Electric Bicycle Brand Demand Analysis

**Description:**
This repository contains the implementation of a comprehensive data analysis project aimed at understanding the factors affecting the demand for shared electric bicycles offered by a rented electric bicycle brand in the Indian market. The project was conducted to identify significant variables predicting electric bicycle demand and evaluate their impact.

**Problem Statement:**
The rented electric bicycle brand has experienced significant revenue declines and seeks to understand the factors influencing the demand for shared electric bicycles. The company aims to identify significant variables predicting demand and assess how well these variables describe electric bicycle demand in the Indian market.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used for this analysis comprises various factors potentially influencing electric bicycle demand, including datetime, season, holiday status, working day status, weather conditions, temperature, feeling temperature, humidity, windspeed, and user counts (casual, registered, and total rental bikes).

**Project Objectives:**
1. Import the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. Establish relationships between the dependent variable (cycle count) and independent variables (working day, weather, season, etc.).
3. Conduct appropriate statistical tests to determine the effects of working day, season, and weather on electric bicycle demand.
4. Formulate null and alternative hypotheses, check assumptions of the tests, and set significance levels.
5. Calculate test statistics and make decisions to accept or reject null hypotheses based on the results.
6. Draw inferences from the analysis to provide insights into the factors influencing electric bicycle demand in the Indian market.

**Usage:**
1. **Data Import and Exploration:** Start by importing the dataset and conducting exploratory data analysis to understand its structure, characteristics, and distributions.
2. **Relationship Establishment:** Analyze the relationship between the dependent variable (cycle count) and independent variables (working day, weather, season, etc.) through visualizations and statistical tests.
3. **Statistical Testing:** Conduct appropriate statistical tests (such as t-tests, ANOVA, and chi-square tests) to determine the effects of working day, season, and weather on electric bicycle demand.
4. **Hypothesis Formulation:** Formulate null and alternative hypotheses, check assumptions of the tests, and set significance levels for hypothesis testing.
5. **Inference Drawing:** Calculate test statistics and make decisions to accept or reject null hypotheses based on the results, drawing inferences to provide insights into the factors influencing electric bicycle demand.
